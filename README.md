How to use it on Windows (for dummies):

1. Download/Clone this repo.
2. Node modules should be already installed. Otherwise you can use 'npm install'
3. Open a terminal in the directory you downloaded and type 'node index.js'
4. Enter the URL of the strawpoll.
5. Enter the option to use. (Starts at 0)
6. Profit? (Proxies are automatically grabbed from proxyscrape.com)

* Works with IP check
* Does NOT work with CAPTCHA
* You may overload the strawpoll servers so be careful and DO NOT USE HIGH RATIO OF VOTES PER SECOND.
